        - content: "<code>/categories/{categoryId}</code>"
      correctAnswer: 3
      question: "Let's say you need to build RESTful URIs for various resources in an online shopping site. Say you have <code>Category</code> as an entity that represents all the product categories on the site. What would be a RESTful URI to lookup a category with ID <code>categoryId</code>?"
    - answers: 
        - content: "<code>/products</code>"
        - content: "<code>/products?id=25</code>"
        - content: "<code>/products/25</code>"
        - content: "<code>/products/id/25</code>"
      correctAnswer: 2
      question: "The site also has a <code>Product</code> entity. This has been designed to be a first level entity like <code>Category</code>. What would be a good RESTful URI for a product with ID 25?"
    - answers: 
        - content: "<code>/categories/products</code>"
        - content: "<code>/categories/products/{productId}</code>"
        - content: "<code>/categories/products/{categoryId}/{productId}</code>"
        - content: "<code>/categories/{categoryid}/products/{productid}</code>"
      correctAnswer: 3
      question: "If the <code>Product</code> entity were to have been designed as a sub-resource under the <code>Category</code> entity, what would the URI for <code>Product</code> be?"
    - answers: 
        - content: "<code>/categories/products</code>"
        - content: "<code>/categories/products/{productId}</code>"
        - content: "<code>/categories/products/{categoryId}/{productId}</code>"
        - content: "<code>/categories/{categoryid}/products/{productid}</code>"
      correctAnswer: println
      question: "If the <code>Product</code> entity were to have been designed as a sub-resource under the <code>Category</code> entity, what would the URI for <code>Product</code> be?"
